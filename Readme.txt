Notes:

The workspace is named DMViewer (Steven originally called it DynaMechs Viewer).  This contains the DMViewer project (RobotBuilder) and the RBModeler project (RobotModeler).
Before building, go to Project->Settings and set the location of the WTK, DynaMechs, RBUserIOData (Control GUI) headers and libraries.  

With WTK, you can build on any computer if you have WTK installed, but you can't execute.  This can only be done on Luther's computer.
To run an executable on another computer, copy the executable to Luther's computer.  Run c:\progra~1\wtk\utils\s8unlock [file_to_unlock].  The file will then be unlocked and you can run it anywhere.
Also, the WTK license is from Sense8 and is generated using the WTK serial number (found on the CD case) (last I saw it was in the cabinet in a white packing envelope) and the Volume number from the C drive (which will change if the drive is formatted).
Use the serialnum.exe program to see the harddrive serial number. Give Sense8 this number to renew license each year, do not use the hex serial number as the code will not work then.
The license code for Autumn 2003 is in the file S8codes in c:\progra~1\wtk\utils.

Directories on CD

"Documentation" contains the .doc and .pdf of my report and the RobotBuilder Tutorial, as well as modified RobotBuilder User's Guide.

"DynaMechs4.01" contains the current version of DynaMechs that RobotBuilder is current built with, which includes the updated function for separate X and Y terrain grid resolution.
 When recompiling RobotBuilder, this folder may need to be renamed back to "DynaMechs4.0", or update the project settings.

"Misc" contains the last jpg image file used for startup logo.

"RBUserIOData" contains the code for the library that implements the control GUI.
