and Harbour Research Institute (PHRI) in Yokosuka, Japan. A joint project
with <a href="http://www.cs.nps.navy.mil">Naval Postgraduate School</a>
(NPS) from 1992 to 1994 to develop a better control system. I developed
a real-time graphical simulation of this robot using DynaMechs for the
dynamic and hydrodynamic computations to provide a simulation testbed (and
virtual environment) for control system development environment off-site.</td>

through a through a 3D model of lateral and third ventricles (cavities)

by Duane Marhefka at The Ohio State University (1999) [<a href="mesh5x5.avi">AVI</a>]

mechanism goes up with the square of n, where n is the number of links
on one side of the mesh.&nbsp; Meshes of size n=7 were simulated to show
the stability of the algorithm in implementing the loop constraints.</td>

an extension spring for energy storage and reduction of impact forces.&nbsp;
