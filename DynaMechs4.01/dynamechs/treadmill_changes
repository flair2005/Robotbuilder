treadmill changes


dm.h
- added some general utility functions that are utilized in the treadmill code.  If
you would prefer, we can just make them local to dmTreadmill, but they seem like
they would be useful in other circumstances, so I placed them here with some other
general utility functions.

dmTreadmill.h/.cpp
- revamped to support treadmill
- in some aspects this is incomplete - see todo section in header

dmContactModel.h/.cpp
- not really happy with the result -- seems like there should be a more elegant
approach.  The contact model has dependencies on the environment type which
should be handled differently than the 'if' statements that are used.  We can't
really create a new class though, because the environment might not be known
when the class is created (which occurs during file parsing if a .dm is used)
