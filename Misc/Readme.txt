The code for displaying startup picture is commented in WTKGraphics.cpp file,
 at the end of the WTKFGDrawCallback function.
To use the jpg image for a startup picture in RobotBuilder,
 the file needs to be renamed as written in the code.

The code still needs a lot of work to make it functions well & secure
 (regular RobotBuilder users should not be able to change the startup picture,
 unless they have RobotBuilder's code and recompile it).
